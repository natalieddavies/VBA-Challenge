# STOCK MARKET ANALYSIS

Using VBA scripting to analyse real stock market data, I created a script to loop through all the stocks for 2014. The script was generated to also work on 2015 and 2016.

The script outputs the following information:
- ticker symbol
- yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year
- percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year
- total stock volume of the stock
- highlights positive changes green and negative changes red

Additionally, my script returned a summary output of
- greatest % increase
- greatest % decrease
- greatest total volume
